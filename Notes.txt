Quantum Computing is a very fascinating field.
Starting from Advance Calculation to Time Travel Everything is possible.

We know about classical bits such as 0 and 1.The same way in quantum terminology it is Qubits.
A qubit can be both 0 or 1 This is known as superposition.
A Quantum Computer is isolated and kept in a cold environment in order for the particles to be coherent.

Mathematics is the language of physics.The quantum mechanics forms the basis for quantum computing.
So to undertand quantum computing much better one should have a good sounding knowledge of linear algebra.

Vector's are the fundamental building blocks of linear algebra.

So let us start with a vector.

What Exactly is a vector?

A Vector Definiton can be defined in 3 ways
1.Physicist way:- A vector is something which can sit anywhere in a  plane and it has a length and a direction.
2.Computer Scientist:- A vector is a an ordered list of numbers. 
3.Mathematician:- Addition of vectors and different vector algebra eg: V + w 

Now In a 2-d plane lets say x and y .We have a vector R, so the rule is 
any vector on a 2d plane can be represented in the form of a basis vector i.e.

R = rx . x + ry . y
where rx is the projection of r on x axis and ry is the projection of r on y axis.
and x, y are unit vectors

So in quantum computing orthogonal means projection which internally means dot product 

Qunatum Mechanics is linear.So we can apply linear algebra

So we got to know about projection of vector in a 2d plane and basis vectors.
So,in classical computing 0,1 are basis vectors
But,in quantum computing we represnt them using qubits and they have a special notation called as bra and ket.

<0| -> This notation is known as bra

|0> -> This notation is known as ket

So,these terms come from the decomposition of brackets <a|b>

<0| is a row vector [1 0]
where as |0> is a column vector with [1 0]

Similarly <1| is a row vector [0 1] 
where as |1> is a column vector [0 1]
