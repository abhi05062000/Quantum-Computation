# Quantum-Computation

This repository helps one understand the concepts of Quantum Computing from the very basics.It explains what is a qubit.how exactly one can differentiate a classical computer from a quantum 
computer.Concepts of entaglement, superposition and quantum logic gates such as Pauli X gate,Y gate, Z gate,Hadamard gate and quantum algorithms.The repository also consists of 
simulations implemented yusing qiskit.
